18728,I'd like to mention one thing.,0
18729,"But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.",0
18730,I will let the American people decide that.,0
18731,"And the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here in terms of Saddam Hussein.",0
18732,Those decisions generally -- generally are not poll-tested.,1
18733,That's always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime.,0
18734,My plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of a typical community college tuition.,0
18735,"Let me say at the outset, uh - I'm very proud of the record of this administration.",0
18736,"I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned.",1
18737,"We've had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent.",1
18738,But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.,0
18739,There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.,1
18740,Why do we have to do it?,0
18741,"I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.",0
18742,And I'm paying for all that for those guys.,1
18743,"When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you'll go bankrupt.",1
18744,He's had experience in it.,1
18745,"Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies.",0
18746,And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.,0
18747,"We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.",0

18752,"You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago.",1
18753,Because they have to balance their budgets.,0
18754,Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated.,0
18755,"They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space.",1
18756,I suspect we won't agree here tonight.,0
18757,"Now, the tax relief that I propose is directed specifically at middle-income individuals and families.",1
18758,I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.,0
18759,"The facts are after my plan, the wealthiest of Americans pay more taxes of the percentage of the whole than they do today.",1

18762,"Number 3, on the pension funds, I don't know as much about it, but I will say this.",0
18763,And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.,0

18765,I do know what he has said about mine.,1
18766,Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.,1

18770,The treaty does not include these two islands.,1
18771,"I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.",0
18772,We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.,0
18773,We may differ about what the elements of that are.,0
18774,What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.,0
18775,We don't need mass armies anymore.,0
18776,But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.,0
18777,"How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?",0
18778,And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.,0
18779,"You know, going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn't a fundraiser isn't my view of responsibility.",0
18780,Nothing's going to ever happen.,0
18781,We have peace with freedom.,0

18783,Let's get on with it.,0
18784,"Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government's invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child.",0
18785,"The intelligence I looked at was the same intelligence my opponent looked at, the very same intelligence.",0
18786,"I know we're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens.",0

18788,"Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.",0
18789,And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently.,0
18790,Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.,1
18791,I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.,0
18792,"And I think if we get rid of the labels--and I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label ""liberal"" at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away.",0
18793,But beyond that we need to address the economy.,0
18794,"Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.",0
18795,But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.,0
18796,I - I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford's position on gun control has changed.,1
18797,"I've had one position, one consistent position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat.",1
18798,"And, by the way, I like coal.",0
18799,Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.,0
18800,That's not right in America.,0
18801,"And this decision you're about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying I'm going to go fix it but what are we going to do?",0
18802,If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that's a home run for me.,0
18803,And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.,0
18804,So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.,1
18805,"Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.",0

18807,We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.,0
18808,We did not feel that I could commit.,0
18809,"But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?",0
18810,I believe we can do it.,0
18811,"As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.",1

18813,And I'm very proud of it.,0
18814,Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year.,1
18815,Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.,0
18816,"Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill.",1
18817,"We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.",0
18818,"Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.",0
18819,"Look, I fully recognize I'm not of Washington.",1
18820,Bring them back into the mainstream of public life.,0
18821,"It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.",1
18822,"I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.",0
18823,"When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.",1
18824,"If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less.",0
18825,I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.,0

18827,And it's really a shame.,0
18828,So these are three programs which are quite moderate.,0
18829,You took General Motors bankrupt.,1
18830,"Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.",1
18831,"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, ""Now, are you willing to join us?",0
18832,We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.,1
18833,"I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America.",0
18834,That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.,1
18835,"No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.",0
18836,I support the death penalty.,1
18837,But look who's around with him there.,0
18838,"I agree with that, John.",0
18839,I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty.,1
18840,I strongly support term limits for members of the US Congress.,0
18841,And that's why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law.,0
18842,That's got to be changed.,0
18843,"Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.",0
18844,He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.,0
18845,"So what's the message going to be: ""Please join us in Iraq.",0
18846,What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?,1
18847,"Now this tax bill - that hasn't reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two - it's about fifteen hundred pages.",1
18848,And this is something Republicans have used for a long time.,1
18849,Some of our troops are not well-equipped.,1
18850,[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.,0
18851,"States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively.",1
18852,"I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market -- which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home -- I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively.",0
18853,I will keep this nation strong.,0
18854,"Now, that also means that you've got more customers.",0
18855,We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.,1
18856,"But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.",0
18857,"They don't like the use of the word, but may I remind his strong supporters that only last year in the primary, to capture that Democratic nomination, he said, ""I am a progressive liberal Democrat.""",1
18858,Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.,0
18859,And you should go down and take a look at that.,0
18860,"My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.",1
18861,"And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power.",0
18862,We've got to stop some of these frivolous lawsuits.,0
18863,We have the highest foreign debt in history.,1
18864,"Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say ""I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;"" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us.",0
18865,Those words really have to mean something.,0
18866,And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors' conference.,1
18867,Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been.,0

18871,"Well, people got their checks, and they'll continue to get their checks.",1
18872,It is essential that America's word be good.,0
18873,"We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.",0

18881,In partnership with the American Health Association...,0
18882,"Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?",0
18883,"My plan says that we want to raise marginal incomes on family incomes above $200,000 from 31 to 36 percent, that we want to ask foreign corporations simply to pay the same percentage of taxes on their income that American corporations play (sic) in America, that we want to use that money to provide over $100 billion in tax cuts for investment in new plant and equipment, for small business, for new technologies, and for middle class tax relief.",1
18884,And our alliance is strong.,0

18889,That's the highest we've ever been in our country.,1

21531,"That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America.",0
21532,"Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.",1
21533,"Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.",0
21534,"In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.",1
21535,"If you all want the enterprise zones, why don't we pass the dang thing and do it, right?",0
21536,"We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line.",1
21537,"The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists who've looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy.",1
21538,Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America?,0
21539,Your own Council of Economic Advisers -- Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that.,1
21540,"I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.",0
21541,But this can't keep on going.,0
21542,I'm not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa - in charge of the largest union in the United States - still free.,1
21543,"I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it.",0
21544,And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.,1
21545,"And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months.",1
21546,"Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years?",0
21547,"We later said no, that's not true.",1
21548,Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.,0
21549,You know people who've lost their jobs and lost their homes?,0
21550,"It's hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free.",0
21551,It's called bait and switch.,0
21552,"And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists.",0
21553,And what's happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly.,1
21554,"But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.",0
21555,"First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street.",0
21556,It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.,1
21557,Let's be honest about it.,0
21558,I have to pay the administration a compliment.,0
21559,There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia.,1
21560,What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?,0
21561,"I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America.",1
21562,Uh - I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.,0
21563,And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.,0
21564,"We see in -- in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against -- against our people there, four people dead.",1
21565,"The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they've been getting it.",0
21566,"So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices.",0
21567,It is the best anti-terrorist report written.,0
21568,I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices.,0
21569,Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear.,0
21570,And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.,1
21571,Nobody would have dreamed it possible.,0
21572,"Actually, Mr. Vice President, it's not true.",0
21573,And I want to tell you what I tell them.,0
21574,They're all patriots but you've got to link arms and work with them.,0
21575,"And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?",0
21576,But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.,1
21577,"When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard.",1
21578,That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time.,0
21579,"Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.",1
21580,We had a guarantee -- and what happened?,0
21581,There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.,0
21582,"That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.",0
21583,"And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now.",0
21584,"And one final comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law.",1
21585,"That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.",1
21586,"I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.",0
21587,"If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.",0
21588,"He's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.",1
21589,"So I, we're going to do better, and we'll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party.",0
21590,It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.,0
21591,"There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant.",0
21592,"So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.",1
21593,[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.,1
21594,"When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.",0
21595,"After all, I was a border governor for a while.",1
21596,"As a matter of fact, I read in the ""New York Times"" where he said he co-sponsored the McCain-Feingold Campaign Fundraising Bill.",1
21597,"We've created, and I'm not aiming at any one person here, I'm aiming at our government -- nobody takes responsibility for anything.",0
21598,First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.,0
21599,And I've got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.,1
21600,She's been doing this for 30 years.,1
21601,I will just say my time is running out here.,0
21602,I signed the partial-birth -- the ban on partial-birth abortion.,1
21603,"If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.",0
21604,I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.,0
21605,"There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.",0
21606,But Washington is a tough town.,0
21607,I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.,0
21608,I look on this as history.,0
21609,Let me tell you what your plan is.,0
21610,"The President inherited a good economy, sure the S&L crisis then were selling assets.",1
21611,"In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it.",0
21612,"And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.",0
21613,"If we pull back in some isolation and say we don't have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we'll get involved in the future.",0
21614,"The first thing I'd do is, during political campaigns, I would urge everybody to stop trying to split this country into fragments and appeal to the differences between us and then wonder why the melting pot is all broken to pieces after November the 3rd.",0
21615,Your premiums are going up.,1
21616,How about Dr. Lou Sullivan?,0
21617,We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years.,1
21618,"My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C.",0
21619,And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror.,0
21620,"Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back.",0
21621,And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.,0
21622,"You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.",1
21623,"And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.",1
21624,And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.,0
21625,"When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon.",1
21626,"And if we don't, we will be spending our children's money.",0
21627,The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough.,0
21628,There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future.,1
21629,"That's a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.",0
21630,I see a young man who is a knowledgeable-in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable-in the whole-in the race-knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them.,0
21631,"But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.",0
21632,And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home.,0
21633,"Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions.",0
21634,"Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.",1
21635,"You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.",0
21636,"My opponent says help is on the way, but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm's way, ""wrong war, wrong place, wrong time""?",1
21637,Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress.,0
21638,I don't believe in liberal activist judges.,0
21639,We're all focused on China.,0
21640,"Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years.",1
21641,So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.,0
21642,"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice.""",1
21643,"No, they haven't had talks in two years.",1
21644,We have a very divided nation.,1
21645,"Mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom, and look at the dramatic changes around the world.",0
21646,You keep your own insurance.,0
21647,And I don't want to see the banks let off the hook.,0
21648,"The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.",1
21649,"Of course, we have to come together.",0
21650,"It's stuck in the Senate, because the trial lawyers won't act on it.",1
21651,But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.,0
21652,And it was one of the largest declines in our history.,1
21653,And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.,0
21654,"I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence.",0
21655,But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,1
21656,"I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.",1
21657,"Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",1
21658,"But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution.",0
21659,And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure.,0
21660,And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.,1
21661,"Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.",0
21662,John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.,0
21663,We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.,1
21664,"You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, ""conservative judges.""",0
21665,"Now, I believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world - not just America - perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has already indicated, the most important election in our history - it isn't the label that he wears or that I wear that counts.",1
21666,"And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good.",0
21667,One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong.,1
21668,Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.,0
21669,We sign a peace treaty.,1

21679,I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny.,0
21680,He says mistakes were made.,0
21681,If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?,0
21682,"Well, I'll tell you what it means.",0
21683,"If - Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country - but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war.",1
21684,"And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.",1
21685,I thought that was wrong.,0
21686,Take a look at Libya.,0
21687,We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world.,0
21688,"How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been.",0
21689,But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.,0
21690,That is the obligation upon our generation.,0
21691,People care a lot about their land and care about their environment.,0
21692,I would use pressure and diplomacy.,0
21693,We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.,0
21694,"Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country.",0
21695,"We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches.",1
21696,And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that.,0
21697,"No, I might as well just go with -- --",0
21698,I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state.,1
21699,"Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.",0
21700,We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.,1
21701,We've got a bumper crop this year.,1
21702,I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families.,0
21703,And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.,0
21704,But I believe together we can make great progress.,0
21705,And we're on the track on this one.,0
21706,But not due to his policies.,0

21708,He is for full public financing of Congressional elections.,1
21709,"And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.",0
21710,"I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem.",0
21711,"And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don't work, we should cut.",0
21712,"I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example.",0
21713,These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month.,0
21714,"And in a way, I should be complaining.",0
21715,"And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it.",1
21716,"Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.",1
21717,We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.,1
21718,"for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.",0
21719,It's a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East.,0
21720,"And I've never discussed Whitewater, as I've told you personally.",1
21721,"We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.",0
21722,I think it's very difficult.,0
21723,"And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.",0
21724,"And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.",1
21725,And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.,1
21726,"And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.",0

21728,I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,1
21729,And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening.,0

21731,There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.,0
21732,And I've been a careful steward of your tax dollars.,0
21733,They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.,0
21734,"They assumed that the uh - inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh - therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh - tried to increase the uh - the tax uh - payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations.",1
21735,"These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.",0
21736,Many of her friends took bigger deductions.,1
21737,That is a very serious charge against the president.,0
21738,"The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.",1
21739,"Well, the people need it, that's the point.",0
21740,"But I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack.",1
21741,"In addition to that, we need to have - uh a realization that we've got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world.",1
21742,Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?,0

21744,More and more women are being elected.,1
21745,"I mean, this guy, this is too much.",0
21746,"I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America.",0
21747,And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers.,0
21748,"But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.",0
21749,I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.,0
21750,"We've got agreements, but they are still there.",0
21751,"But we're not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars.",0
21752,We have -- we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.,0
21753,I did it for the very reasons you say.,1
21754,And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility.,0
21755,They look at our -- our decision to -- to cut back on our military capabilities.,0
21756,I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.,1
21757,The laws regarding that always were State laws.,1
21758,"First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible.",0
21759,"And it's going to take all the nations together, just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago.",1
21760,This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.,1
21761,"And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.",1
21762,He shouldn't have made that decision.,0
21763,We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.,1
21764,The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field.,0
21765,But it certainly ought to be the long-term goal of all Americans and I think it is.,0
21766,And the reason we've gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze.,0
21767,"Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.",1
21768,"But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books.",1
21769,"This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.",0
21770,Opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America.,1
21771,Now that's not a flip-flop.,0
21772,"I believe the president made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was: build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job and go through the U.N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort.",1
21773,And we kicked this man out of Kuwait.,1
21774,"As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.",0
21775,But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country.,1
21776,I thought it was a good program.,0
21777,The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.,1
21778,They're not left or right.,0
21779,That is the present American position.,0
21780,It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.,0
21781,He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote with him and lost by one vote.,1

21783,"We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction.",0
21784,I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs.,0
21785,I referred to the Dingle-Norwood bill.,1
21786,I'm not proud of it.,0
